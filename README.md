     -----------------------------

## What is it?

It's a zero-runtime-dependencies node.js server framework, based around the idea of using plugins rather than middleware.

## Why?

Something to do during lockdown. I wanted to build something that was entirely built using ES6 modules from the ground up, and this seemed fun.

## Should I use it in production?

Almost certainly not

## Is it under active development?

Almost certainly not
